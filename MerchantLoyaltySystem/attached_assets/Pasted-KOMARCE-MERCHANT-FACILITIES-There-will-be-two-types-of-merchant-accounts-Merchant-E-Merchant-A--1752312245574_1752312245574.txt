KOMARCE MERCHANT FACILITIES

There will be two types of merchant accounts:

Merchant

E-Merchant

A merchant will register using their email, mobile number, name, and password, and will log in using their mobile number and password.

If a merchant forgets their password, an OTP will be sent to their mobile.

Merchant profile will display the merchant referral ID.

To withdraw any type of income, the profile must be updated with details such as:

Father's name

Mother's name

Voter ID number or Passport number

Blood group

Nominee information

A merchant will receive special benefits from other online marketplaces through Komarce Marketplace:

No platform fees required

The company will handle marketing and promotions under certain conditions, such as providing 5% reward points on BDT 100,000 boosting

Komarce will help increase the merchant's sales

Each merchant will have a dedicated online store or website within the Komarce Marketplace, similar to Daraz, including their own custom banner.

Three Separate Wallets Must Be Created:

Reward Point Wallet

Points will be given to customers for purchases from this wallet.

Income Wallet (Shows three types of income separately)

15% cashback on every BDT 1,500 discount given

2% cashback on every BDT 1,000 discount under the merchant-to-merchant affiliation program

Merchant Royalty: 1% of all sales from all merchants will be accumulated and distributed equally among all merchants at the end of the month

Funds can be transferred from Income Wallet to Komarce Wallet, with 12.5% VAT and service charge applied

Komarce Wallet

Add Balance: Merchants can top up their wallet using bank or mobile financial services

The Komarce Wallet will function as a full-fledged MFS (Mobile Financial Service)

Three Methods to Recharge Points:

By directly paying cash to the company

By transferring money to the company's bank/mobile account and then requesting reward points

By paying through a payment gateway from the merchant dashboardâ€”points will be recharged automatically

All transactions, transfers, and incomes will have a history log.

For each product sale, discounts must be provided:

Reward Points (Mandatory)

Cash Discount (Optional)

The reward point distribution system can be selected by the merchant from their dashboard:

Manual Mode

Regardless of the sales amount, the merchant can give reward points as per their preference

Automatic Mode

Points will be preset for each product

Points will be preset as a percentage based on the sales amount

Currently, there are no conditions for merchants, but in the future, merchants will be required to distribute 1,000/2,000/5,000 points to customers to stay active.

For E-Merchants:

Product selling options must be available through the company

E-Merchants will buy products at DP or TP rates and sell them at MRP

Merchants should have the option to enable or disable product reviews.

A merchant can view reports of how many points were given to customers per product or per supplier. For example, a cosmetics seller can check how many points were distributed to customers for products supplied by RIBANA.
